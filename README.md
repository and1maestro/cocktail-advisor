# cocktail-advisor
This simple chatbot uses a CSV dataset with 425 alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. It can be used to learn more about different cocktails, get recommendations etc. Also it has an ability to remember user's preferences (for example, favorite ingredients), but the implementation is very basic. 

To start the app open cmd and run "python main.py" (Might need to open main.py in IDE and enter own OpenAI api key).

requirements.txt is present.
